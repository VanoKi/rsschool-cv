        About myself:
    </h2>
    <div>
        <p>
            For 11 years I worked as a firefighter.
            I was rescuing people, cats, dogs and, once, even ducklings.
            But over time, I realized that I had reached the limit in my development.
            All these years I have been interested in information technology.
            And now the time has come to go to a new boundless world in which
            there are no limits for development. This new field of activity
            has absorbed me so much that I will not stop on the way to my goal:
            to become a senior Fullstack developer. Discipline is not an empty
            words for me, over the years I have learned to complete the assigned
            tasks accurately and in time, acquired stress resistance and developed
            resourcefulness and the ability to think outside the box. Such my
            qualities as purposefulness and perseverance will help me in this.
